### Hey, I'm hadir ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Hadir Kadri, a computer science engineer with a passion for mobile development. I have experience in developing mobile applications, with a focus on Flutter and android native development.

One of my greatest strengths is my problem-solving ability. I enjoy taking on complex challenges and finding creative solutions that meet both technical and business requirements. Whether it's debugging code, optimizing performance, or working with APIs, I'm always up for the task.

I'm also curious about game development and am interested in exploring this exciting field. I believe that my skills in programming, problem-solving, and creativity will be valuable assets in game development, and I'm excited to learn more about this field.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about emerging technologies and staying up to date with the latest developments in the industry. I'm also a dedicated team player who enjoys collaborating with others to achieve common goals.
